## OmniClassBeta
This GitHub project consolidates documentation and feedback for CSI's OmniClass Web API service.

This Readme will be updated according to the current status of the OmniClass API service.

### The OmniClass API service is currently in the beta testing phase.
- Only those organizations or individuals who have been accepted as beta testers will be able to use the service at this time.  [Contact CSI](mailto:csi@csinet.org) regarding becoming a beta tester.
- Errors, slow response times, and unfinished features are to be expected;  Please help us to improve the service by reporting problems in our [issues section](https://github.com/csi-net/OmniClassBeta/issues), using the "bug" label.
- New features and improvements to existing features are still being considered.  Please submit any suggestions to our [issues section](https://github.com/csi-net/OmniClassBeta/issues), using the "enhancement" label.
- Existing features are subject to change or removal.  Such modifications will be noted on this document in addition to email notifications.

**All beta testers will receive a Vendor Key** (a GUID string) that is required when sending API requests.  This allows us to authenticate users and track utilization.  *(Please Note that Vendor keys are used exclusively in the OmniClass context and cannot be used to access any personal or organizational information in any system outside of CSI offices.)*

The following list describes what is available **now** through the API:
- Access to the most recent OmniClass table versions  
*(backdated versions will be added in the near future)*
- Table and Classification properties  
*(Numbers and Titles, but also descriptions, IDs for relevant objects within other classification systems, and more)*
- Hierarchy of Classification objects  
*(Each Object, whether it be a table or a classification, clearly lists itâ€™s immediate children and parent objects)*
- Table Version and Revision Information  
*(Release Status, publish date, and version numbers)*

We are working to implement the following in the **near future**:
- Backdated Table Versions  
*(The ability to request objects by version is implemented already, but the older versions are still being converted to the new database)*
- A new website that exposes the same information available through the API with a clear, navigable interface
- Implementing more API request types for gathering and searching information

The following are features that will be made available **later on but before leaving the Beta testing phase**:
- SSL and an improved authentication process  
*(Vendor keys are currently included in http requests to the API server, which can be intercepted)*
- Ability to create, manage, and share custom OmniClass Table Versions  
- Language translations of Tables and Classifications along with API methods for requesting multilingual data



### OC_Data.dll
OC_Data is a .NET package that provides an easy way to access the OmniClass API.

- Download OC_Data.dll from this repository and add it as a reference in your project.
- Included is the OCAccess class that exposes all implemented API requests and Response classes that contain returned data.
- The source code in Visual Basic has been provided as a reference.

### Direct API Access
It is possible to access the API without linking to OC_Data.dll.  Accessing the API via urls will result in the raw XML files being returned.

The API is currently accessible at:  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc  
Clicking this link will take you to an "Endpoint not found." page and return no XML file.  This is not a bug.  Append an API Request to generate an XML response.

All requests require at least 1 argument.  Append a ? and provide your vendor key like this:  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetAllTableGuids?key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

For requests requiring multiple arguments, separate the arguments with &  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetOCTable?key=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&table=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

### API Requests Currently Available

The following requests are implemented.  Visiting these urls in a browser will show the XML file returned by the request.

- GetAllTableGuids  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetAllTableGuids  
Arguments: *key*  
Returns a list of GUIDs that represent OmniClass Tables

- GetOCTable  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetOCTable  
Arguments: *key*, *table*, *version (optional)*  
Given a GUID for a table, returns that table's properties and a list of GUIDs representing it's root objects.  Setting version to a valid Version GUID will get the table's status as of that version, rather than the newest version which is the default.

- GetAllVersionGuids  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetAllVersionGuids  
Arguments: *key*, *table*, *unpublished (optional)*  
Given a GUID for a table, returns a list of GUIDs representing versions of that table.  This list will only include the most recent revision of each.  unpublished=true will also include table versions that are not yet published.

- GetOCVersion  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetOCVersion  
Arguments: *key*, *version*  
Given a GUID for a version (or revision), returns that version's properties

- GetAllRevisionGuids  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetAllRevisionGuids  
Arguments: *key*, *version*, *unpublished (optional)*  
Given a GUID for a version, returns a list of GUIDs representing revision-versions of that table, including the submitted version.  unpublished=true will also include revision-versions that are not yet published.

- GetOCObject  
http://ocservice.csinet.org/OmniClass_Service.svc/GetOCObject  
Arguments: *key*, *guid*, *version (optional)*  
Given a GUID for an object, returns that object's properties and a list of GUIDs representing its child objects.  Setting version to a valid Version GUID will get the object's status as of that version, rather than the newest version which is the default.

### Feedback and Support
Please post all service feedback or requests for technical support to the [issues section](https://github.com/csi-net/OmniClassBeta/issues) and apply an appropriate label (*bug* for service breaking issues, *enhancement* for feature requests or suggestions, or *help wanted* for questions and support).

**A GitHub user account is required to submit or comment on issues**. This only requires an email address and allows for public discussion of issues by CSI staff and fellow beta testers. As issues are created, we encourage testers to read and comment on issues if they feel they can contribute.
